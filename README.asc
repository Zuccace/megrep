== A different way
In this branch megrep goes trough the file line-by-line only once.
I thought this would be faster than reading the file many times.
However after performing some tests it seems that going trough the file manu times _is_ faster in ~90% of the time.

Read the comments in the source to get the idea of how this is implemented.

Please note that this branch will probably stay as a seperate branch forever and will not get updated anymore.
